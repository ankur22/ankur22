# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my github page.

## Current Projects

I'm currently working on the following projects:

* Godzilla
This is a monorepo which is where i will be placing all of my services that will run in my kubernetes cluster.  
https://github.com/ankur22/godzilla

* k8s-ansible
I've created my own k8s cluster using Raspberry Pis. I'm using ansible to provision and setup k8s on the cluster using ansible and all the script lives in this repo.

# Hi there 👋

Welcome to my github page.

## 🔭 I’m currently working on

* Medium Picker
There's a lot of great sources for interesting blog posts and articles on the web, and unfortunately it's not possible to read them all. This project tries to make it simpler to find the next article to read based on a list of subscribed articles.

* Godzilla
This is a monorepo which is where i will be placing all of my services that will run in my kubernetes cluster.

* k8s-ansible
I've created my own k8s cluster using Raspberry Pis. I'm using ansible to provision and setup k8s on the cluster using ansible and all the script lives in this repo.
